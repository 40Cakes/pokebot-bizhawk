# How it works
There are 2 components of this bot:

1.  `bizhawk.lua` is a Lua script that runs in Bizhawk's Lua console ([Bizhawk Scripting API](https://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk/LuaFunctions)).
This Lua script reads a bunch of different locations GBA memory and writes them to memory mapped files for quick access.

2. `bot.py` is a Python Script that reads and writes to the memory mapped files created by `bizhawk.lua`. The script uses a combination of image processing and game state to work.

# Notes

This project is just the result of a bored holiday, I am by no means a professional Python or LUA developer so I apologise for the very scuffed code you have just stumbled upon, this was a huge learning experience and it goes without saying that this code comes with no warranty.

- This bot is very much in ALPHA - you will almost definitely run into bugs! If you decide to run this, please provide feedback and report bugs in Discord #⁠bot-support❓ channel
- It is possible to run the bot with unthrottled speedup, most shiny hunting methods will work at unthrottled speeds but you'll be more prone to getting stuck
- Only tested and confirmed working on Windows
- Only 1 bot instance can run at a time (for now)

# Todo
- Fix auto catching (disabled by default, bot will just pause on a shiny)
- Finish the GUI
- Add egg hatching/breeding
- Add roamer Pokemon tracking
- Add config to catch certain Pokemon with specific balls
